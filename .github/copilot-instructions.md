# Copilot Instructions

## Language & Style
- Use TypeScript with strict typing
- Follow linting rules and best practices
- Prefer explicit types over inference where it improves clarity

## Frontend
- Use vanilla JavaScript/TypeScript - no component frameworks (React, Vue, etc.)
- Write plain CSS - no CSS frameworks or preprocessors
- Keep DOM manipulation straightforward

## Testing
- Default to Playwright for E2E tests
- Focus on user-facing behavior over implementation details

## APIs
- Assume API integration is a common requirement
- Use fetch with proper error handling
- Type API requests and responses
